# Port-sniffer
Implementing a cli port sniffer in rust.

Pub/Sub is a way for services and clients to communicate with each other in real-time. One common use case of Pub/Sub in Rust is to connect multiple devices or servers and reflect any changes or updates across them simultaneously. One can use these payloads to update systems, send chat app messages, live geolocation tracking, and more. Another use is networking in Web Assembly, a pre-compiled binary format that will replace JavaScript in the browser. This will enable developers to make website front ends with another language besides JavaScript. Instead of having to interpret JavaScript at runtime, it compiles other programming languages to binary before the page loads.
